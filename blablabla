Firebase Auth

Firebase Auth is a service that can authenticate users using only client-side code.
It supports social login providers Facebook, GitHub, Twitter and Google. 
Additionally, it includes a user management system whereby developers can enable user
authentication with email and password login stored with Firebase.
Realtime Database

Firebase provides a realtime database and backend as a service.
The service provides application developers an API that allows application 
data to be synchronized across clients and stored on Firebase's cloud.
The company provides client libraries that enable integration with Android, 
iOS, JavaScript, Java, Objective-C, swift and Node.js applications. 
The database is also accessible through a REST API and bindings for
several JavaScript frameworks such as AngularJS, React, Ember.js and Backbone.js.
The REST API uses the Server-Sent Events protocol, which is an API for
creating HTTP connections for receiving push notifications from a server. 
Developers using the realtime database can secure their data by using the 
company's server-side-enforced security rules.
Firebase Storage

Firebase Storage provides secure file uploads and downloads for Firebase apps,
regardless of network quality. The developer can use it to store images, audio,
video, or other user-generated content. Firebase Storage is backed by Google Cloud Storage.
